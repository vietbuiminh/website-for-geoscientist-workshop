# Introduction to GitHub Pages

[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a free service provided by GitHub that allows you to host static websites directly from your GitHub repositories. It's an excellent way for individuals and organizations to publish project documentation, portfolios, or blogs.

## How GitHub Pages Works

- Each GitHub user or organization can create a website using a special repository named `<username>.github.io`.
- You simply push your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to this repository.
- GitHub automatically builds and serves your site at `https://<username>.github.io`.

## Custom Domains

You can personalize your GitHub Pages site by configuring a custom domain. This allows you to use your own domain name instead of the default GitHub URL.
