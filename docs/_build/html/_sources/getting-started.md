## 2. Edit Configuration

- In your forked repository, locate the `config.yml` file.
- Update the settings as needed (e.g., site title, description, author).

### _data/authors.yml

If you visited the demo site, and especially on the about page. There is an author component, to be able to customize and edit this.

> Navigate to the `_data` folder in your repository and locate the `authors.yml` file. On GitHub, click the file and then select the **Edit** button (pencil icon) to update the author details with your own information. Save your changes to apply them to your site.

Then move to the section Markdown file, the reason that this can appear, is by specify the name of the author (aka you) in each of the new markdown page you created. 


### Markdown file

The front matter is a block of YAML metadata placed at the top of a Markdown file, enclosed by triple dashes (`---`). It defines page-specific variables such as title, layout, author, categories, tags, and more. For the Minimal Mistakes theme, a typical front matter might look like:

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
layout: single
author: vietbui
categories: [workshop]
tags: [setup, guide]
---
```

This information helps Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theme render the page correctly and organize content across the site.

> **Tip:** Inside the template, the main fields you may want to modify in the front matter are:
> - `title`
> - `overlay_image`
> - `author`
> - `categories`
> - `tags`
> 
> Adjust these values to personalize your siteâ€™s pages and appearance.
