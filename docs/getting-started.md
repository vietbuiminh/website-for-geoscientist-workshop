## 2. Edit Configuration

- In your forked repository, locate the `config.yml` file.
- Update the settings as needed (e.g., site title, description, author).

### _data/authors.yml



### Markdown file

The front matter is a block of YAML metadata placed at the top of a Markdown file, enclosed by triple dashes (`---`). It defines page-specific variables such as title, layout, author, categories, tags, and more. For the Minimal Mistakes theme, a typical front matter might look like:

```yaml
---
title: "Getting Started"
layout: single
author: vietbui
categories: [workshop]
tags: [setup, guide]
---
```

This information helps Jekyll and the Minimal Mistakes theme render the page correctly and organize content across the site.

> **Tip:** Inside the template, the main fields you may want to modify in the front matter are:
> - `title`
> - `overlay_image`
> - `author`
> - `categories`
> - `tags`
> 
> Adjust these values to personalize your siteâ€™s pages and appearance.
